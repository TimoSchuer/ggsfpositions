}
\arguments{
\item{ncol}{integer, number of columns in the grid. Defaults to 3.}

\item{x_spacing}{numeric, horizontal spacing between grid points. Defaults to 0.01.}

\item{y_spacing}{numeric, vertical spacing between grid points. Defaults to 0.01.}

\item{bound}{sf polygon object that defines the boundary within which points should stay.}

\item{hjust}{numeric between 0 and 1, horizontal justification. 0 = left, 1 = right. Defaults to 0.5.}

\item{vjust}{numeric between 0 and 1, vertical justification. 0 = bottom, 1 = top. Defaults to 0.5.}
